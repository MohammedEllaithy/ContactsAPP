Reason for using MongoDB not mySQL:-

1-In MongoDB, data is stored in JSON-like documents that can have varied structures and this improves query speed.

2-Storing data in JSON form is Very important : 
Because most of data which are sent to and from servers are sent in JSON form.
 Speed
3-MongoDB can fast and easy process the data. But this is valid up to your data is in document format.
 We can say that itâ€™s speed automatically increases as it is handling a large amount of unstructured data 
within seconds which feels like magic

4- MongoDB : is nosql which measn that there is limited constrains and Documents are able to have their own unique structure 

5- MongoDB : The connection between two tables is easier... because mongo doesn't use joins, but Arrays
